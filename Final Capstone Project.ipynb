    "A friend wants to open a new fusion Indian restaurant in Toronto. He plans to make it slightly upscale, and wants to attract a diverse range of customers, rather than having a predominantly Indian customer base. He is confused about which neighborhood he should open his new restaurant in.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have suggested that he use 3 criteria to pick the location.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) His restaurant should be located in an upscale neighborhood, surrounded by similarly upscale stores and restaurants.\n",
    "2) His restaurant should be located in a neighborhood that doesn't already have too many Indian restaurants. How many is too many? We will need restaurant data from Toronto to be sure. For now, I would like to have no other Indian restaurant within 500 metres of my friend's new restaurant.\n",
    "3) His restaurant should be located in a neighborhood that already attracts a diverse crowd. E.g., a neighborhood that has multiple Italian, Korean, Mexican, etc. restaurants is better than a neighborhood dominated by, say, Korean restaurants.\n",
    "\n",
    "My friend likes these 3 criteria and would like me to suggest locations that meet these 3 criteria. The rest of this project involves using Foursquare data to identify neighborhoods that meet these 3 criteria."

    "(3) Diverse, but not Upscale\n",

In this final test, I will rank the Upscale & Diverse neighborgoods by how many Indian restaurants they already have, and I will suggest that my friend pick one of the neighborhoods with fewer Indian restaurants."

    "\n",
    "1) A map of Toronto to get started. This will come from Folium.\n",
    "2) A basic dataset of boroughs and neighborhoods in Toronto, like the one I created for the Week 3 assignment of Segmenting and Clustering neighborhoods in Toronto. This will come from Wikipedia, just like in the Week 3 assignment.\n",
    "3) Finally, for the K-means clustering, I will need data on the top venues in each neighborhood within a given radius. This will come from Foursquare, just like in the Week 3 assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, my approach will be similar to the analysis in Week 3 with just two major changes\n",
    "(1) I care only about the top restaurant venues, rather than all the top venues (i.e., I will be ignoring any venue that is not a restaurant).\n",
    "(2) I need to define some metric that estimates the degree of diversity of restaurants, and the degree of upscale-ness of restaurants, for the K Means clustering.\n",
    "    For measuring diversity, I will use the cuisine of each restaurant as raw data. I will get the cuisine from the 'Venue Category' field in Foursquare, which classified restaurants into \"Afghan restaurant\", \"African restaurant\", \"American restaurant\", etc. in the Week 3 Lab of segmenting neighborhoods in New York. The higher the variety in cuisine names, the higher that neighborhood's diversity score will be.\n",
    "    For measuring upscale-ness, I will use the expensive-ness of each restaurant (using the 1-4 \"dollar\" scale) as raw data. I am looking for a neighborhood that is dominated by 2-dollar and 3-dollar restaurants, because 4-dollar will be too upscale, and 1-dollar will be too cheap."
