    "A friend wants to open a new fusion Indian restaurant in Toronto. He plans to make it slightly upscale, and wants to attract a diverse range of customers, rather than having a predominantly Indian customer base. He is confused about which neighborhood he should open his new restaurant in.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have suggested that he use 3 criteria to pick the location.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) His restaurant should be located in an upscale neighborhood, surrounded by similarly upscale stores and restaurants.\n",
    "2) His restaurant should be located in a neighborhood that doesn't already have too many Indian restaurants. How many is too many? We will need restaurant data from Toronto to be sure. For now, I would like to have no other Indian restaurant within 500 metres of my friend's new restaurant.\n",
    "3) His restaurant should be located in a neighborhood that already attracts a diverse crowd. E.g., a neighborhood that has multiple Italian, Korean, Mexican, etc. restaurants is better than a neighborhood dominated by, say, Korean restaurants.\n",
    "\n",
    "My friend likes these 3 criteria and would like me to suggest locations that meet these 3 criteria. The rest of this project involves using Foursquare data to identify neighborhoods that meet these 3 criteria."
